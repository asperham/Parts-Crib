# Parts-Crib/Luminosity Sensor Build Instructions

# Introduction 
This project utilizes the STM32, a V2 link, blue pill and the VCNL 4010 proximity sensor. The STM32 is an Arduino alternative that uses the Arduino IDE and has similar functions. For this project we will be using the I2C pins on the STM32 in order to get readings from the VCNL 4010. The V2 link simply allows us to use the STM32 with the Arduino IDE and the VCNL 4010 is a proximity and ambient sensor. The purpose of this project is to turn on another device when the user puts their phone close to the proximity sensor. To emulate this, we will simply use an LED on one of the output pins on the STM32 to ensure that we assembled it properly. 

The following is a schematic of the breadboard:
