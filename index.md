Progress Report: 
Everything is going on track, however I am still wating for my STM32 bluepill to come in the mail. It should arrive by Monday October the 21st. Once I get my bluepill, I will be able to test my connections to ensure my board will work properly. The only problem I currently face is that i'm not sure what the output pins are on the bluepill, but this should not be a problem once I can sit down and experiment to see what works. No changes have currently been made to the budget and everything is on schedule. I will work over the reading week to ensure I can meet the deadlines.
