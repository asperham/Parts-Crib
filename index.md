Breadboard Milestone
Breadboard has been completed and is functioning. One thing to note is that there is no output screen since the STM32 does not have a serial console; so I can only show the breadboard working.

The following pictures are the breadboard:

Progress Report: 
Everything is going on track and I have gotten the STM32 bluepill and used it to complete my breadboard. I had some issues while getting my breadboard to work since the STM32 was not able to find the sensor. This was fixed by setting up the I2C pins on the STM32 and I had to fix some of my soldering. I had some help from my partner Rob in order to do this. No notable changes have currently been made to the project.

Progress Report: 
Everything is going on track, however I am still wating for my STM32 bluepill to come in the mail. It should arrive by Monday October the 21st. Once I get my bluepill, I will be able to test my connections to ensure my board will work properly. The only problem I currently face is that i'm not sure what the output pins are on the bluepill, but this should not be a problem once I can sit down and experiment to see what works. No changes have currently been made to the budget and everything is on schedule. I will work over the reading week to ensure I can meet the deadlines.
